# Requirements traceability

The canonical MALENJO specification and the Developer Guide remain the controlling sources for implementation.

Each implementation pull request must record:

| Field | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Requirement | Guide/source identifier or quoted requirement |
| Component | MALENJO module, adapter, service or packaging component |
| Implementation | Paths and architectural decision |
| Tests | Unit/integration/E2E/security/performance evidence |
| License review | Dependency provenance and redistribution conclusion |
| Status | Planned / Implemented / Verified / Blocked |

No module is complete merely because its navigation entry exists. Completion requires the guide acceptance criteria, security review, performance budget and relevant offline/fidelity tests.

## Phase 1 traceability

| Requirement | Component | Implementation | Test/evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| One file library | Files / Document Library | `src-tauri/src/suite/library.rs`, `src/suite/files/FileLibrary.tsx` | library index + UI | Implemented |
| Recent files | Library index | `last_opened_ms` sorting | Rust/interactive | Implemented |
| Import/open | Dialog + native commands | `chooseAndAddDocuments`, `open_library_document` | path/type tests | Implemented |
| Save As/export copy | Native file pipeline + workspace UI | `save_as_library_document`, Files actions, workspace Save As | Windows CI + manual E2E pending | Implemented, verification pending |
| Never delete source on library removal | Library index | `remove_library_document` changes index only | code review | Implemented |
| Type routing | Shell router | `workspaceForDocument` | `route.test.ts` | Implemented |
| Dirty state | Workspace session | `session.ts` | `session.test.ts` | Implemented model; editor wiring pending |
| Same-file Save | Workspace-native adapter contract | `stage_library_document` + `commit_staged_document` + app-data recovery backup + source-change manifest | Rust token/path tests; Windows E2E pending | Implemented, verification pending |
| Offline startup | Shell/native services | no network call; services remain lazy | CI/manual offline test pending | Implemented, verification pending |

| Lost-update protection | Native staged save | source size/modified timestamp captured in staging manifest and rechecked before commit | code review + Windows E2E pending | Implemented, verification pending |
| Symlink overwrite defense | Save As | existing symbolic-link destinations are rejected | code review + Windows E2E pending | Implemented, verification pending |
